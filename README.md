# ecosystem
A simulation of an ecosystem.

There are 3 animals currently:
- the parabola bird - only dives for its prey in parabolas
- Fox - chases the Rabbits around
- Rabbit - eats shrubs

There is no gui at the moment, you kinda just have to know what the terminal output means

The render_server.cs is for if you want to render it. I have not figured out to render it yet, so at the moment it just outputs stuff similar to the ecosystem.py.
